**Data Filtering:** The dataset was filtered to isolate records specifically related to the Sports and Shooter genres to align with the business problem.
**Handling Missing Values (Nulls):** Records with missing Global_Sales data were removed or handled to ensure accurate sales aggregations. Records lacking a Critic_Score were identified and excluded from the average score calculations to prevent skewed results.
**Data Type Standardization:** Ensured that sales columns were properly formatted as numeric (float/decimal) data types rather than text to allow for mathematical aggregation in later steps.
